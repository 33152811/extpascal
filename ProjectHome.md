ExtPascal is an Object Pascal ([FreePascal](http://www.freepascal.org)/Lazarus and Delphi) wrapper/binding for [Ext JS](http://extjs.com), a complete GUI Ajax framework, made in JavaScript, for Rich Internet Application (RIA) development. ExtPascal lets you use Ext JS from Object Pascal commands issued by the server. It brings the structure and strict syntax of the Object Pascal for programming the web browser. ExtPascal will wrap [JointJS](http://www.jointjs.com) into future releases.
